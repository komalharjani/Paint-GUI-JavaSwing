# Paint Program Using Java GUI
I built a program where users can draw shapes and save them into files, much like the program Paint. My program uses the Java Swing library. This was completed as part of an assignment at The University of St Andrews for Object-Oriented Programming.

## Getting Started
In order to get the project running on your local machine, save the files in a folder and specify the path in your command line. And then run the following to compline and run. 
javac Main.java
java Main.java

## Deployment

This program is currently not available to run in a browser.
